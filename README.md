Arduino sketch for boblight / hyperion.

The sketch is a combination of one found in the arduino forums http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=272082.100 and from this https://code.google.com/p/adalight-ws2812/. Tested using Arduino Nano, FastLED 3.0.3 and a linux HTPC (KodiBuntu) with boblight and hyperion.
