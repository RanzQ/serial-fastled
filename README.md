serial-fastled
==============

Arduino sketches for different serial protocols using [FastLed 3.0.3](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED).

The Adalight sketch is a combination of one found in the arduino forums http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=272082.100 and from this https://code.google.com/p/adalight-ws2812/. Will be updated to support more leds (now uses an unnecessary buffer). Tested using Arduino Nano, FastLED 3.0.3 and a linux HTPC (KodiBuntu). Works with both [boblight](https://code.google.com/p/boblight/) and [hyperion](https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion), I prefer to use the latter.

The second sketch is for [Glediator](http://www.solderlab.de/index.php/software/glediator), download the jar and RXTX dll [here](http://jlog.org/rxtx-win.html). Tested on Windows 8.1 (64bit) with 32bit Java.
